How happy I am that I am gone! My dear friend, what a thing is
the heart of man! To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable,
whom I love so dearly, and yet to feel happy! I know you will
forgive me. Have not other attachments been specially appointed
by fate to torment a head like mine? Poor Leonora! and yet I was
not to blame. Was it my fault, that, whilst the peculiar charms
of her sister afforded me an agreeable entertainment, a passion
for me was engendered in her feeble heart? And yet am I wholly
blameless? Did I not encourage her emotions? Did I not feel
charmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature, which, though
but little mirthful in reality, so often amused us? Did I not 
but oh! what is man, that he dares so to accuse himself? My dear
friend I promise you I will improve; I will no longer, as has ever
been my habit, continue to ruminate on every petty vexation which
fortune may dispense; I will enjoy the present, and the past shall
be for me the past. No doubt you are right, my best of friends,
there would be far less suffering amongst mankind, if men and
God knows why they are so fashioned did not employ their
imaginations so assiduously in recalling the memory of past sorrow,
instead of bearing their present lot with equanimity. Be kind
enough to inform my mother that I shall attend to her business to
the best of my ability, and shall give her the earliest information
about it. I have seen my aunt, and find that she is very far from
being the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be. She
is a lively, cheerful woman, with the best of hearts. I explained
to her my mother's wrongs with regard to that part of her portion
which has been withheld from her. She told me the motives and
reasons of her own conduct, and the terms on which she is willing
to give up the whole, and to do more than we have asked. In short,
I cannot write further upon this subject at present; only assure
my mother that all will go on well. And I have again observed,
my dear friend, in this trifling affair, that misunderstandings
and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice
and wickedness. At all events, the two latter are of less frequent
occurrence.
In other respects I am very well off here. Solitude in this
terrestrial paradise is a genial balm to my mind, and the young
spring cheers with its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgiving
heart. Every tree, every bush, is full of flowers; and one might
wish himself transformed into a butterfly, to float about in this
ocean of perfume, and find his whole existence in it.
The town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find an
inexpressible beauty of nature. This induced the late Count M to
lay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersect
each other with the most charming variety, and form the most lovely
valleys. The garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, even
upon your first entrance, that the plan was not designed by a
scientific gardener, but by a man who wished to give himself up
here to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart. Many a tear
have I already shed to the memory of its departed master in a
summer-house which is now reduced to ruins, but was his favourite
resort, and now is mine. I shall soon be master of the place.
The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days,
and he will lose nothing thereby.
MAY.
A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my
dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that
I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the
tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,
a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of
the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence
of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of
that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around
us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads
my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its
power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with
longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress
upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might
be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite
God! O my friend but it is too much for my strength I sink
under the weight of the splendour of these visions!
MAY.
I know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot, or
whether it be the warm, celestial fancy in my own heart which
makes everything around me seem like paradise. In front of the
house is a fountain, a fountain to which I am bound by a charm
like Melusina and her sisters. Descending a gentle slope, you come
to an arch, where, some twenty steps lower down, water of the
clearest crystal gushes from the marble rock. The narrow wall which
encloses it above, the tall trees which encircle the spot, and the
coolness of the place itself, everything imparts a pleasant but
sublime impression. Not a day passes on which I do not spend an
hour there. The young maidens come from the town to fetch water, innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the occupation of
the daughters of kings. As I take my rest there, the idea of the old
patriarchal life is awakened around me. I see them, our old ancestors,
how they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at the
fountain-side; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded by
beneficent spirits. He who is a stranger to these sensations has
never really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after the
fatigue of a weary summer day.
MAY.
You ask if you shall send me books. My dear friend, I beseech you,
for the love of God, relieve me from such a yoke! I need no more
to be guided, agitated, heated. My heart ferments sufficiently of
itself. I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfection
in my Homer. Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of my
blood; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady, so
uncertain, as my heart. But need I confess this to you, my dear
friend, who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing my
sudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from sweet
melancholy to violent passions? I treat my poor heart like a sick
child, and gratify its every fancy. Do not mention this again:
there are people who would censure me for it.
MAY.
The common people of the place know me already, and love me,
particularly the children. When at first I associated with them,
and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, some
fancied that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me in
exceeding ill-humour. I did not allow that circumstance to grieve
me: I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed.
Persons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly aloof
from the common people, as though they feared to lose their importance
by the contact; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone to bad
joking, affect to descend to their level, only to make the poor
people feel their impertinence all the more keenly.
I know very well that we are not all equal, nor can be so; but it
is my opinion that he who avoids the common people, in order not
to lose their respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hides
himself from his enemy because he fears defeat.
The other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl,
who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around to
see if one of her companions was approaching to place it on her
head. I ran down, and looked at her. "Shall I help you, pretty
lass?" said I. She blushed deeply. "Oh, sir!" she exclaimed.
"No ceremony!" I replied. She adjusted her head-gear, and I
helped her. She thanked me, and ascended the steps.
MAY.
I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found no
society. I know not what attraction I possess for the people, so
many of them like me, and attach themselves to me; and then I feel
sorry when the road we pursue together goes only a short distance.
If you inquire what the people are like here, I must answer, "The
same as everywhere." The human race is but a monotonous affair.
Most of them labour the greater part of their time for mere
subsistence; and the scanty portion of freedom which remains to
them so troubles them that they use every exertion to get rid of
it. Oh, the destiny of man!
But they are a right good sort of people. If I occasionally forget
myself, and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yet
forbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, with
genuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, or
arrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, all
this produces a good effect upon my disposition; only I must forget
that there lie dormant within me so many other qualities which
moulder uselessly, and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed.
Ah! this thought affects my spirits fearfully. And yet to be
misunderstood is the fate of the like of us.
Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone! Alas, that I ever knew
her! I might say to myself, "You are a dreamer to seek what is
not to be found here below." But she has been mine. I have
possessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemed
to be more than I really was, because I was all that I could be.
Good heavens! did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised?
In her presence could I not display, to its full extent, that
mysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature? Was not
our intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of the
keenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very eccentricity,
bore the stamp of genius? Alas! the few years by which she was
my senior brought her to the grave before me. Never can I forget
her firm mind or her heavenly patience.
A few days ago I met a certain young, a frank, open fellow,
with a most pleasing countenance. He has just left the university,
does not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than
other people. He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many
circumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information.
When he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek
(two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came to
see me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteaux
to Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had read
through the first part of Sultzer's theory, and also possessed a
manuscript of Heyne's work on the study of the antique. I allowed
it all to pass.
I have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, the
district judge, a frank and open-hearted man. I am told it is a
most delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children, of
whom he has nine. His eldest daughter especially is highly spoken
of. He has invited me to go and see him, and I intend to do so
on the first opportunity. He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges,
which can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking,
and which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife,
as it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court.
There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable
sort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerable
in their demonstration of friendship. Good-bye. This letter will
please you: it is quite historical.
MAY.
That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised
heretofore; and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling.
When I consider the narrow limits within which our active and
inquiring faculties are confined; when I see how all our energies
are wasted in providing for mere necessities, which again have no
further end than to prolong a wretched existence; and then that
all our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigation
ends in nothing better than a passive resignation, whilst we amuse
ourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliant
landscapes, when I consider all this, Wilhelm, I am silent.
I examine my own being, and find there a world, but a world rather
of imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness and living
power. Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile and
dream while pursuing my way through the world.
All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not
comprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up should
wander about this earth like children, without knowing whence they
come, or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives,
but guided like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod,  this
is what nobody is willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it is
palpable.
I know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit that
they are happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with their
playthings, dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watch
the cupboard, where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and,
when at last they get a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, and
exclaim, "More!" These are certainly happy beings; but others
also are objects of envy, who dignify their paltry employments,
and sometimes even their passions, with pompous titles, representing
them to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfare
and glory. But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of all
this, who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen converts
his little garden into a paradise, and how pat
Werther's initial response to Albert's arrival is to leave-and it would have been wise for him to do so, in retrospect-but, without any explanation other than his "inner restlessness," he stays.
For a brief month, Albert, Lotte and he achieve something of a balance: the love triangle works, because each member in it respects the others. 
Albert is a very good man - too sensible perhaps for Werther's taste, but a good friend nonetheless. 
He speaks, in a way, for Wilhelm (and, it will come to be clear, for the sensibility of the editor), and might be a great friend to Werther were it not for Lotte.
Some of the major themes of the novel gain clarity and force in this section.
Werther's self-knowledge, for instance, begins to take on a tragic sheen. He writes of his impossible love for Lotte, "How clearly I have seen my condition, yet how childishly I have acted. How clearly I still see it, and yet show no sign of improvement." In this distinction between self-knowledge and self-satisfaction, Werther articulates his romantic disposition. Enlightenment thinkers might be inclined to equate self-knowledge with self-realization. Descartes' cogito, ergo sum places the onus of ego squarely on the thinker, implying that reason is the realm of the self. Ben Franklin, in his Autobiography, implies that acting virtuously is simply a matter of recognizing the right from the wrong in a given choice and choosing the right. Werther, in contrast, says that no matter how well he knows what he should do (for instance, "I should leave now that Albert has arrived"), his heart will ultimately steer his course, for better or worse. Werther recognizes the contradictions in his being, but rather than seeing them as problematic, sees them as definitional. This tendency is pure Romanticism.
Werther's inability to acknowledge his inherent contradictions lie at the root of his discontent. The passing references to suicide in earlier sections become central during this month, as Werther describes suicide as an example of an act in which reason has failed to satisfy the self, and passion must therefore take over. Of course, in his debate with Albert, Werther is speaking on a very personal level. He is quite comfortable with his suicidal tendencies. In speaking in defense of suicide he is not upholding an abstract cause, but is rather defending himself. Werther's right to suicide is, in many ways, the basis of his own being. He reserves the right to end his own life if he should ever need to. In this opinion, Werther draws from the ancient Romans; Pliny the Elder, for instance, in his Natural History, states that the ability to free oneself from the miseries of existence is what separates man from animal.
